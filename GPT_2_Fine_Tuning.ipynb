        "You should understand the basics of PyTorch and how a training loop works before getting started. [This official PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html) serves as an excellent introduction. Familiarity with the workings of GPT2 might be useful but isn't required. The code has been written for clarity and not re-use. I'd advise refactoring it for actual projects. I've liberally taken bits from [Chris McCormick's BERT fine-tuning tutorial](https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/), [Ian Porter's GPT2 tutorial](https://snappishproductions.com/blog/2020/03/01/chapter-9.5-text-generation-with-gpt-2-and-only-pytorch.html.html) and the [Hugging Face Language model fine-tuning script](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v2.0.0/examples.html#language-model-fine-tuning) so full credit to them. Chris' code has pretty much provided the basis for this script - you should definitely check out his [blog](https://mccormickml.com/tutorials/).\n",

        "- Using the [nlp](https://huggingface.co/nlp/) library to load in the dataset and setting up the training workflow, which looks to streamline things rather nicely.\n",
        "- [Accumulated gradients](https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255) - this gives larger effective batch sizes than Colab allows (GPT2 is a large model, and anything more than a batch size of 2 would be enough to get a CUDA out of memory error on Colab).\n",
        "- [Freezing layers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/1431). This is the process of only changing the parameters in selected layers, made famous by the [ULMFit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) process.\n",
        "- [Using 'past'](https://huggingface.co/transformers/quickstart.html#using-the-past) when generating text. This takes in the previous state when generating successive items of text. I didn't need it.\n",
        "- [Tensor packing](https://snappishproductions.com/blog/2020/03/01/chapter-9.5-text-generation-with-gpt-2-and-only-pytorch.html.html). This is a neat way of fitting in as much training data in each batch. \n",
        "- [Hyperparameter search](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/using-hyperparameter-search-in-trainer/785/10). I settled quickly on values that seemed to produce decent values, without checking if they were optimal."

The \"Man O\\'War\" quickly became my favorite DIPA; the Rusulka Vanilla Stout is a good thick, sweet stout; and the Ironclad is a top notch IPA. The only big miss on their beers I\\'ve had is the Big Chuck Barleywine. It could probably benefit greatly with age, but at this age all there is to taste is the alcohol.  Nonetheless, I had enough to convince me that the other beers I hadn\\'t had from them would be top notch... and they are! The reason for the 2 stars should not reflect the quality of the brewers, they obviously know their craft well! The servers are great and friendly.... but relying on two servers to wait on 100+ customers says a lot about how inexperienced management must be. In fact, after waiting 15 mins at a dirty table I was finally able to track down someone I guessed was an employee to let them know we were even there! After another 5+ mins, the GM finally stopped over to take our drink order. The smugness of this guy was amazing. The thought of offering a simple apology never seemed to enter into his head. This is the time a server finally stopped by to pick up the non-final check left by the party before us... who didn\\'t seem very pleased when leaving. The toast & cheese was good, but by the time we were able to dig into their heartiest offering of food, saltines and butter may have been equally pleasing.'"

I had a large chicken wrap which was perfectly balanced. The only reason we will not be coming back is because we were closed for a long time.

There were several that walked in and the bartender was quite rude at first and had to do so.  My wife ordered a side of chicken fingers and was quite satisfied.  We ordered the wings.  It's a little too oily but not bad.  Maybe not really as good as the fried fries I do at their places.

My first visit was in September of the 2012 (thanks to a friend's help) and I took the class for some fun on a Saturday.It's a smaller space so if you get to the right room, you have to know where the class is. This was my first time at this class.  My first instructor was Alyssa but I really loved this class. It was a lot cheaper than the class I attended, especially for this level of difficulty. I thought it was more of fun to have her \"Swiss'ed\" than just to move out and see where the class.I should be. She did a few steps away from the class.  The class. It was nice to a \"Totally cool. There were a lot of difficulty to make sure.  We got a different ways. You didn\n"

They just wanted everyone and we just had to look up and ask for the gender's height. My kids were only on one rack and they were not allowed to run around so they didn't just play on the other side of the pack, but there is a smaller store here and there so kids can run around. My son and I both grabbed some water from the front and just grabbed some hot water from the back of the store. They gave the store three stars because we spent lots of time. It's pretty much a bad, over priced shop, but not terrible store that the kids are nice kids were helped they were just as well behaved and left at all.\n"

I was pleasantly surprised with the speed of food being served. The food itself was actually a decent portion and we finished up my meal with a few slices of pepperoni. I loved the variety of sauces offered and the quality of the meat in the meatballs and sauce, as well as the ingredients that we requested. I did my second chance at the last time and I had to knock down my order a few times.

For example, they have a \"best\" beer in Madison. This is a neat spot to pick up some crafty treats. The selection is fairly limited and a bit less crowded. In addition to a couple of shelves of random crafts, it's a good place to try out some of the interesting items. For those who balk at the name of the place you'll find a few things that will surely go through.

I was in need of a bit spicy ramen so I ordered a chicken and mushroom with extra soy sauce and my friends had the spicy ramen. It was really good and filling to the max (no extra charge). The prices are also pretty reasonable and the service was pretty good too. We ordered the matcha soft drink (supersweet and sour) and added soy sauce. It was an amazing meal! They give you the option to add the sweetness of spicy ice cream or sweet condensed ice cream which I love but also served ice cream (I think it was like a mix of condensed milk, sweet/tart milk?) and made to match.

They weren't as knowledgeable as I asked but didn't take my business to another company or try.  My experience at the store was also subpar for my book.  I was told I was on the hunt for something and that I had to buy it at the store which I was not.  The store itself was clean and well lit.  I had to go to the other location and check the condition of the item since I was not alone.\n"

I had the spicy beef and there was nothing too special. The meat was more tender than you'd like. The tofu came with vegetables which I really enjoyed but could have added a little more flavor but I was very happy with the overall flavour of the meat. My friends had the chicken curry with curry rice and it's very flavorful. The curry tasted very blend and the curry was very flavourful. The rice had a nice chew and very filling. It was a bit on the salty side. Overall, it was a good meal and I'd definitely visit again and would recommend!\n",
