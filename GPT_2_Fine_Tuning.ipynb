    "This is a simplified script for fine-tuning GPT2 using Hugging Face's [Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) and PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should understand the basics of PyTorch and how a training loop works before getting started. [This official PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html) serves as an excellent introduction. Familiarity with the workings of GPT2 might be useful but isn't required. The code has been written for clarity and not re-use. I'd advise refactoring it for actual projects. I've liberally taken bits from [Chris McCormick's BERT fine-tuning tutorial](https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/), [Ian Porter's GPT2 tutorial](https://snappishproductions.com/blog/2020/03/01/chapter-9.5-text-generation-with-gpt-2-and-only-pytorch.html.html) and the [Hugging Face Language model fine-tuning script](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v2.0.0/examples.html#language-model-fine-tuning) so full credit to them. Chris' code has pretty much provided the basis for this script - you should definitely check out his [blog](https://mccormickml.com/tutorials/).\n",
    "\n",
    "I should mention what the script doesn't cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the [nlp](https://huggingface.co/nlp/) library to load in the dataset and setting up the training workflow, which looks to streamline things rather nicely.\n",
    "- [Accumulated gradients](https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255) - this gives larger effective batch sizes than Colab allows (GPT2 is a large model, and anything more than a batch size of 2 would be enough to get a CUDA out of memory error on Colab).\n",
    "- [Freezing layers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/1431). This is the process of only changing the parameters in selected layers, made famous by the [ULMFit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) process.\n",
    "- [Using 'past'](https://huggingface.co/transformers/quickstart.html#using-the-past) when generating text. This takes in the previous state when generating successive items of text. I didn't need it.\n",
    "- [Tensor packing](https://snappishproductions.com/blog/2020/03/01/chapter-9.5-text-generation-with-gpt-2-and-only-pytorch.html.html). This is a neat way of fitting in as much training data in each batch. \n",
    "- [Hyperparameter search](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/using-hyperparameter-search-in-trainer/785/10). I settled quickly on values that seemed to produce decent values, without checking if they were optimal."

This was the worst place in town, when I came here for lunch and was really impressed. I'm glad I had the burger but I definitely didn't get the fries. It's the best burger in the town.

The parking lot is a little, but the restaurants are decent (though the selection was relatively limited). The food is decent (although some of the options are a tad pricey). The only problem with the food is a small hole in the wall that could have been. However, it definitely is a clean-cut option for a place that could use some better food if they can find something good. And the patio is quite large to accommodate a large group of people. The atmosphere is clean-cut and very cozy. I highly recommend it!\n"

A couple of people I spoke to said it was ok, it tasted like a bunch of old, crappy beers. They also had some bad quality beers. I was disappointed to find the staff were nice. It came with a great selection of items, a little overpriced and the service was great.  For me it was nice to see they had some good food to go.

We took them a few minutes to get us to the pizza, and we had a second order.  We arrived the first time and the pizza was ok, but the two times that I had to be there. The place was kind and accommodating. They had something to ask for. If you like Italian food (or you're a member of a community) then this place is the spot for you.\n"

The owner of a large selection of guitars has stopped by to check out the store and has a great selection of guitars. I'm not even close, but I've got a really good deal on pretty awesome stuff like the Acoustic guitar, the Acoustic guitar-tune-based guitar, the Ensemble guitars, and the Gretsch guitars. This is really going to help the sales person, because I'd go to a store and pick up something, to have them check them out, and have the owner check them out with my daughter (so I don't have to keep telling her I'm a fan of them). Also I love the music, and the music is good.\n"

The rice salad was great and pretty tasty, but not enough to justify giving our two cents. Other than that the place seems good as always. The owner seemed to be super polite (he would let me know when I needed to refill it) and friendly.

I have had great things at this place but I have always wanted to try a steak dinner, and my first one was in Vegas when it was out on the Strip. Today I had steak dinner at the old-fashioned (and still somewhat delicious) Burger Queen restaurant at Mile High. The burgers tasted very good and tasted fresh. The waitress was super friendly, we asked her some questions and she explained the menu to us and told us our options. When we finally decided we would try this steak dinner, the waitress took our order and explained the menu. The food was always great! The place itself was fun and welcoming, the food and service was always attentive and the server seemed knowledgeable. The prices were also great!I do give the waitress a 5/10 rating for the quality and service, but that's only because it's my home and is not my regular seat. \n"

It was cool having a place for a game that everyone seemed to enjoy. It was open 24/7. We ordered a cheese, a meatball, and cheese toast. It was served with tomato, sausage and salad with the rest of the meal on toast. It was pretty good. There is really nothing special about that place.

You can pick it up at one of three other stores around town : the one at East and North. The other one at the other end of the street is a strip mall and the other one at the corner is another strip mall (and still in downtown).  And you can get your coffee anywhere, from Starbucks to Kwik. Both can also be very cool.  The staff is attentive and courteous.

We go a few times a week though as far as my health is concerned. The staff is attentive and it takes a long time to make sure your order has been ordered.The service was quite good however.

The room is small, and the space feels small and cramped. This is probably the closest place I've had to a room with a decent pool and a swimming pool. The bar is pretty good; they offer to provide specials, although that would be a bit pricey. If you are interested in this place, a little bit more space is definitely worth buying. The music was good; the band was awesome and the drinks were very good. We were not impressed with the food, which is somewhat a plus. This could be our only night since we had dinner here earlier in the week. Not bad, but it was disappointing. Overall, this place is worth the price.\n"

The cigar has a very light amount of tobacco inside and is light with very little sugar content.  If you are trying to decide on a cigar, you probably just need a little extra puff.  This particular cigar is on my list of top 25 cigars I've ordered and is a great recommendation.The prices for 5 of them are $16/box for a box with 8 of them.

I don't know if they got them all out and it took 10 mins.  I guess they have no clue if they have the food order ready.  So a customer got a plate and a fork and it was a large box.  I took my food to the store and the owner did not do a thing or make my order and that is what is going to happen!  There was a couple of times where I was just like \"why are you there!?\" and I could not find the food.

If you order something you can't eat, the food may not be cooked at all for the meal. We only got the chicken shawarma with tomato. We would go back if it was as good. I personally ordered the fish fry and it was good but I think the fish is too fatty and the shrimp was good. The shawarma tasted like it was cooked on a grill and tasted like it was fried in it. The shrimp was very bland and the rest of the shrimp looked like fried meat. I ordered the green chili beef and it had a very sour taste to it so it had a good amount of protein in it. We ordered the fried chicken and it was good but the green chili beef was a bit salty and the green chili beef was not that delicious. The other dishes were very good, but nothing to\n"

We were given a beer and some wine, then asked if it was a $10 per bottle. The wait was about 20 minutes and he took the credit and asked if we were interested.

The almond cupcake was perfect! The strawberry cupcake was also fresh and very well made. The almond cupcake was delicious, however, the strawberry cupcake lacked in flavor and the texture of the cupcake was too dense. This cupcake did not look like it would be made at all.

The kids do get their walks and they all need some playing time.  I know that some of these walkers are pretty busy, so I got a few people to play with.  The playground area is small, and you can get your own playground.  The park itself is great for all ages, but it still lacks the variety of options for all kids.  I would've loved for there to be an arcade on the walls.  My friend and I went there around 3 and it was great.  It's a really cute place, and the people are generally nice people.

A few tables down in the lobby are more reserved, but the food tasted good too.  They had some fantastic salad choices, which I enjoyed the most, as well as some excellent pizza.  I will return back if we are in the area, and plan to return here for another visit.  The food here was not too bad, although the service was slow at best.\n"

The last time we took a sample of their burgers at The Fajitas they had a little bit too much oil on the chicken meat. I am a fan and not sure they are able to handle the extra oil and so the steak came out hot and I felt like it had burned my steak. There is no warranty on this thing.\n"

      "0:  incompleteWhen I heard of the \"doublespoon\" I decided to try it.   I know, it sounds pretty obvious, and I'm not trying to put too much weight on it.  However, I had a couple problems with the food.First, the fries were really good.  They had a lot of fresh-cooked potatoes, carrots, carrots, some meat or mushrooms.  Not very tasty but not too greasy.  The other issue I had was that the fries were really thin on the outside, while my meat tasted great on the inside. I ended up cutting my fries short.I got a 2-1/2 pound burger (1/2 c).  It was great with chicken in a sauce, gravy, lettuce, and tomato dressing on top.  I'll be back.\n"

      "0: commentWe ordered the chicken munch with chicken and the turkey entree and it was delicious.  We were told by the lady that we had to call out at 9pm on weekdays as we were waiting for a truck.  But, she said, the truck was empty because it was closed on Friday and we could have left with lunch or dinner in the morning, but the lady told us we had to schedule an appointment at 9pm.   The sandwich had a good flavor and was light on the chicken; it was not spicy but had the typical munchy flavor of chicken with a very thin sauce.  Our server was a little hesitant but said there was no rush because the food would be ready in two days.  We could order the beef munch and the lamb wtihs with bacon to go.\n"

      "0: gersI was pretty excited to get my first tattoo on the skin. Being my friend's age at this point, I wanted to check out some tattoos. I wanted to learn about tattoo history in general, so I took them to the tattoo shop. I didn't know how to properly get the tattoo that I was looking for, and it was hard. However, the shop was a great, I guess, as the owner.  I decided to give the tattoo a try, not expecting much from it.  I had a bit of an attitude toward the staff, and it made sense, as the prices were reasonable.  It was a little pricey for a tattoo shop that I didn't need to go to the salon, but I can't complain because my work is done right.  The staff was super friendly!  I would probably go back there for their tattoos, though.As for the tattoos.  I have never seen anything like it before, as their prices are very high.\n"

They only had \"shrimp\" and they never added the veggies to the burger and they never added the cheese for the shrimp.  The shrimp on the burger was very bland and almost like they didn't have any flavor for it.  In general they don't care about serving fish.  It's just more than that if you order one large burger.  I would have given them 5 stars if the shrimp were less then 1/2 of the size of the burger they are serving.   The fish was very salty so I couldn't decide how much would be left after the shrimp was cooked to the tiniest point to get the fish.

We sat in the waiting room for about 45 minutes, and were asked to place an order on a stand. The manager asked the manager if he could make the server sit next to us so we could sit at the table with him. He refused for an hour. He refused again on an other day. And that was in a restaurant which is not a place where the workers have the best standards of service. I am disappointed in how I had to wait 45 minutes to take my order.

Gym machines are fun for a gym player or a group of 20 to play with. There is also plenty of cardio machines and warm-up and stretching equipment to play with.  The gym is very small and can get pretty packed at times, especially during the winter (I found it easier to find the gym when the heat was in). I like that they have locker rooms. I can go to the gym and I enjoy the warm-ups and runs and the fitness classes for the guys I've never had. However, if you're tired and desperate, I would advise you to try more machines.\n"

The new apartments, with lots of new amenities, are a huge step up from old apartments.I've lived here three times for five years.  I'm never seen here for much.  They've changed their tenants a lot.  The new apartments have very little new seating.  There are really little restaurants around, just small restaurants that get served by very few people.  They also tend to have a few parking spots available.  My only complaint is that there is one parking lot. I think it might be a little overzealous, but it is definitely good if you're not a fan of the \"big guy\" attitude.\n"

      "0:  commodWe live in the Phoenix area and I loved this place. The decor is a bit of a hit or miss. But overall it was fun being there. It was quite crowded and it's not difficult to find a sit down place and watch the game in the living room. But the seating is quite solid. They have a little arcade and they have seating inside which is quite nice. I definitely had a good experience. They have TVs which you can play at anytime, although they do have a couple TVs upstairs which they still don't have with us. I have a small TV in a chair by the wall. But I think that it's worth it to have something available if you want to watch some sports and not have to go to the theater to watch games. Our server was nice but the lady who helped us was a little annoying. We ended up finding a chair and the girl that helped us was in a big sweat pants.\n"

They asked me to bring my pizza to where it shouldn't have been to make it hot.

We're in the neighborhood, in a very large group, and I haven't found a bad review I like before. I usually take the time to consider how much he might care about my opinion, or if he actually cares.\n"

I have tried the fried eggplant and the salad but this was the first time I was happy with the food.  The service was really good, but the food was just not good enough to last much longer. My mom always had the veggie pancake which was great. The lady who helped me make my sandwich tasted like she was trying to put some chicken on top, and was giving a bad rating.

Prices were not too high. I had a large plate and two glasses which I thought were good but nothing spectacular but nice. It's a decent little strip mall, not anything too extravagant, but not too fancy. It has a nice strip atmosphere, and has plenty of seating too. The people in line were pleasant. They knew where to go. As the day went on, I noticed that I was staying in my room in a place close to the elevator so I decided to take a break in and to have a drink. The restaurant was located in the same building as I was at. The restaurant was located in the same hotel. This is nice for the environment of walking in. The food was good. The portions were huge. Overall, I got everything the average place would, and it was delicious.\n"

The staff was friendly and helpful and was really helpful in getting me what I needed for a birthday.  The decor was a bit old school and I didn't think the place would last as long.   The place is located in the shopping plaza at the entrance to the Old Post Office shopping center.     My first time coming, it was pretty empty.    We walked in and were greeted by several other employees in the kitchen that were friendly and knowledgeable.  I enjoyed the food and had no complaints.    They have the same standard drinks available, and the prices are reasonable.   The only reason I gave 5 stars is that my drink selections were not the best (I don't normally go to their beer/wine lines or their food selection).   My only complaint is that\n"

This place had over 300 bottles of cork I got when I walked in for a drink (for the money).  At one point, you'd hear the \"Gooey\" and the \"Good\" and I would hear the \"Aww, you have too much cork.\"  I got the \"Noodle\" and they had it on a stick.  All the other drinks I'd received at this place weren't made as advertised and the cork was just so sweet and flavorful.  If you want a great, authentic cork, just make sure you check with the staff to make sure you can actually make it.

My favorite is the \"super crispy\" sandwich.The place is clean, modern, modern, modern looking, spacious and well stocked with everything.  The only thing that bothers me is that it is an average place for lunch, but it's got a decent menu for anything.

There are many boxing classes and they are well managed.  The quality of the equipment is amazing.  They have multiple TVs and a cardio room, so there is no \"free\" seating.  They have a good variety of supplements and you can watch a lot of great cardio.  Their equipment is a little bit too much for me to feel comfortable with, so I'm not sure if the equipment is better suited to my own body.

The restaurant is on the lower end of the spectrum for prices, but they have a lot of food for less.  The staff is extremely friendly and everyone was quite excited about the food at the other restaurant.  Service was good.

The guy who worked the counter next to the bed and kitchenette was just really friendly and attentive to her requests. The table in the back that I had to check in with him was a little dirty so I left the room with a dirty table. The only reason I was not a big fan of this was the way it is now.

      "0:  retrospectThis is the only restaurant I've ever been to that doesn't take reservations. It's a really nice little space with a great service. Prices are fair - about $1 each with free breakfast, which is really great. The only downside is that they charge you if you have a credit card for the restaurant and the food isn't on paper as a separate account. But I'm not a customer - they do have a free voucher option which I'll get on the website - so just be prepared for that!The only thing that is a little weird about this place is the menu. They don't have anything special on the menu - it's just on paper. I don't know if I would call it a restaurant or a restaurant but in that case this is definitely not my type of restaurant. Overall, I would not go back! But the price was really good, nothing wrong with them.\n"

They gave us one of the better deals in Charlotte and I am very happy with that.The store is located near the University Hospital. It's really big! They have a huge section of high end clothing, accessories, jewelry and accessories that they've got on sale. The store is packed with unique vintage items from around the world, and a great variety of vintage and brand new styles.

The food is pretty good, and the prices are fair for what you get. My friends and I also ordered the breakfast plate, which is a solid combo of rice with a side of hot chocolate toasted coconut. My friend and I each got a side of eggs Benedict and a side of toast, which was also good as was the order of one side, but what really impressed me about it was that everything was on the menu, and on the menu seemed to reflect everything. All the other options were just pretty mediocre. The prices, though, are a bit high given how low they are. I have to say it's a solid combo of the rice and breakfast plate, which is good.

My only complaint is the chicken with tomato sauce, which I feel would be a great value.The service here is fine and the food is great, and the quality of the food (in both sauces and meats) is excellent, as is the fact that the servers are friendly and kind to make you feel welcome.

The employees were friendly, very professional, had good conversation with us and we were extremely satisfied. We were told by one of them that the prices could be cheaper due to the availability of new products. As I'm a little impatient I figured I'd give it a try and get the deal in time. We ordered the chicken teriyaki w/ meat and veggies. The portion was large enough to accommodate all of our needs and the toppings were good.  We also ordered the green tea mochi which included a nice refreshing refreshing shot of green tea.  It's a traditional Chinese lunch special that is served over rice with a bowl of hot water for a quick drink.I am a huge fan of the chicken, but I wish there was a more flavorful option for my salad. I am not a huge fan of the toppings of the greens. But I did like the red bean\n"

They let us know that it would be done so they had a good idea of what we wanted to see and got us to go out and check it out. I was amazed how well that turned out and was definitely impressed by the customer service. They even did a great job with fixing the issues.

There were a bunch of tables and chairs, and a nice outdoor patio.  I asked for the chicken tikka masala soup to be served, and both were delicious.  I also asked for my husband's breakfast burger.

I think the menu would probably go down.  There is a couple things on the menu that I didn't want at the time.  Firstly the fish was lacking in flavor but it did seem to come back in shape for several weeks.  My first order was to bring a small beef stew with rice and vegetables.  Unfortunately after several hours of this stew eating, there was almost nothing left.  This stew has a good flavor, but in some places that taste good the taste is really weak.  I was happy with this order and it is the same thing at other restaurants. I would definitely recommend this place again.  It is just nice to stay in the area!\n"

My biggest complaint is the food.  Sometimes they have very limited selections so I cannot order any type of salad, etc.  When we've ordered enough salads or dips to satisfy our appetites, the food can become quite overwhelming.   I've tried a couple of salad and dip specials and the salads are pretty good, but I've had the dips, which have a bit of vinegar sauce on the outside (probably better than most things), and they're not salty enough.  The salad, however, is excellent.  The onion rings are very good and cooked well.  The salad is a little pricey.  The fries are amazing, but the portion is tiny and not enough for everything that you want.  My wife loves the grilled chicken and it's great\n"

      "0:  ironyI was really looking forward to my day at the salon. The staff and the atmosphere were all great. However, the quality of the product was a bit limited compared to the size of the place and salon, which i noticed was still getting better. My husband was on a budget with an acrylic gel manicure and he paid a bit more than what i could imagine. The store was clean though, so it was pretty well organized and the staff seemed to care about the overall customer experience. However, the hair color that i saw looked terrible. I tried again several times to get a new color, but the color didn't match my current color. I had no idea how to change the color of the color so I called the store to complain about that. The staff kept saying there was a problem but after several tries they told me it would take forever because we paid the price the day before. I left a message with the stylist and was told the color could take two weeks to get\n"

      "0:  empoweredSo very disappointed.  In hindsight, what surprised me was the lack of service.  So much hype around the idea of food in the store that you should get a bottle of wine and a piece of food, then come back and grab a small container of the beer.  My husband and I ordered a pizza (they call it \"cactus pizza\") and both boys loved it.  They both got the pizza twice and each time we got 2 slices of pizza to go.  The pizza we got was the same as the one in the pizza box, and our pizza is the same as the one we ate!  You do have to eat half the pizza for the same quality.  The pizza itself was pretty mediocre and not very good.  If you have a small group of friends, and you go with them, you should probably give them some help or try and make some suggestions.  That was not the case and it was a waste of one star.\n"

The patio is a bit smaller than I'm used to in town, but it's a bit more intimate and inviting. It also has a pretty nice little bar area. The atmosphere is very nice as well, with some nice music played during the day. The place also has a decent beer selection and a good beer selection. There isn't a lot of seating in the bar, and there isn't a lot of table space too. However, you can hear the music from the bartender which is quite nice and really adds to the atmosphere. We got a great deal on beer, and it's a big price for a beer, but not bad for a restaurant!\n"

We tried the steak sandwich (the beef sandwich was pretty good as well). It was the perfect amount of steak, with crisp and crisp lettuce and tomato, and a bit of everything. The sandwich was thin, and my fiance and I had 2 meals at the same time, and both were good. The fries were pretty good and well presented, so I guess we'll get to see that in the future.The only real gripe was the service, and they didn't serve beer in the restaurant.

I did find a few Italian and Italian food spots in my area.  If that wasn't good enough for you, I've had them in the past.  I found the staff very friendly and attentive.  The bread, which is normally a sandwich, is the boba cheese and the dressing is the bolognese dressing.  I liked the sauce that is placed inside them... I found the bread to be a little too sour.  My wife ordered the lamb belly, a nice appetizer for dinner, for the same price.  For a restaurant that is so limited in quality, they definitely need to make a change.

I also like that they have two sizes of pasta for kids who don't like to eat small things, especially since you don't want to eat a whole dish...so it's nice to have different sized plates if possible.The food is nothing special! For example, we ordered our Caesar salad with a side of greens, chicken, and broccoli. Both were ok. The lettuce salad was OK.

I thought it would have been 5 minutes before the place opened and I would probably have gone ahead and ordered the ice cream but I think it took a while to order the order because I really wanted to not have to wait as long.  We paid $20 for the two chips that were the two flavors which cost $15 extra.  The chip were very good but if I just used their coupons I would've paid $15 extra if it weren't for the extra chips.

I've often visited the restaurant in the past, and I don't usually like it when the barkeeps and servers are always waiting behind us.  For this visit, I'm giving a 2 star because I was in the mood for something decent, so I decided to grab a burger and a drink while my friends ate in the restaurant.  For the price you pay, they were quite generous (though I can see why some restaurants would charge the same rate).  After finishing up with some burger and one drink I realized that the price was very reasonable considering the number of people who were drinking and shopping.  In our opinion, the only downside for this place is that they offer no coupon or any kind of special service for the price you pay for the meal.  I was in a rush as all I could taste was salt, so I ordered the ketchup and some\n"

They even had a menu available on the phone so we didn't have to wait an entire afternoon for it to be delivered.

It was a big breakfast with a good sized portion and the food was a small one. When we sat down the waitress let the waitress ask the couple if there was anything else, and she started laughing. Then she went back and apologized for my attitude and tried to give us more suggestions in what we wanted. We sat down on the side of the restaurant which the server sat on very quietly.

I think that this store was hit or miss with me. I know they are not all organized. I was getting compliments and people's phone calls. They just kept repeating that this was a bad haircut and that it was the last time she got it done. I've been to this store and it's been a long time since I have seen the last one.

She made sure we didn't have to wait until the other customers were going out.The place was not the cleanest, and we had to walk out at least a few times before they could even open the doors.

It was a very pleasant experience. This time, I wanted to make a reservation and I told the wait staff so I could give them a warm welcome while I waited. The staff is nice and took my complaint seriously. The one thing that kept me coming back was the way they treated me in the kitchen.

Their service was good, however, their service was weak. Not only did the waiter not give me my usual quick service (which is usually my first sign the food was wrong) but he didn't acknowledge me.

The selection isn't great however, there are many deals for everything you want and everything comes with a discount code that allows you to use the discount code at checkout. They offer a few deals and they sell a wide variety of styles. One thing I find a bit frustrating is I rarely get to find anything I was hoping for.

The bbq sauce is a little too sweet for me - there was no spice.  It had a little bit of spice to it but I was hoping for more of the flavor I would have liked.  I got the lamb and they were very good.  The meat was flavorful but not over cooked for me.  The pork was very chewy but not as dry as the pork ribs.  I would recommend it for the price but probably for a quick lunch for the food price you'll get much better for the money.\n"

It's kind of old school to me, with a good amount of newer equipment.The music is mostly older, but there was a nice selection of local bands.  My favorite band was the \"Strawberry Band\" that I've been able to attend.  And the \"Drunk\" band was a good time, with a bunch of younger bands playing for about $15/person.The staff is usually nice, very helpful, and knowledgeable about everything.  My favorite thing about this club is being able to watch the new \"Drunk\" band play.  It's the most exciting place to watch a show, especially if your playing live.\n"

It's nice that there are clothing stores across town that carry all the stuff you need. However, there are so many other options, not for me, I just found out that my size was on their website so I don't even know where to get them! This wasn't just one small item that they have on clearance, it was so many different styles and sizes! You have to try them, they are pretty good! They have two types of merchandise, one is for kids and one is for women. You can pick from a lot of different clothes, all sizes, and some more.I like the colors. I think they do a great job on that so the other items are a little hard to find but definitely worth checking out! There was a big sign that said they were only for women so I'm usually really\n"

Not wanting to put a huge load, the lady said I was wrong and he would have to put back the last one if he wanted more weight or better equipment. And so he did.  Now if you know how to put a very heavy weight on it and it's just not doing well, it's better to just stick with the weight you want. And if the weights don't do well, they should be lowered so it's easier for them to do.\n"

      "0: aepernickMy first time to this place, the place was so nice. It was a Friday night before 8pm, and as a group I was looking for the most intimate place for a birthday party. However, when I walked in, it was literally empty at that time! The service could be worse, but I'm a pretty nice guy. There is no wait. There are plenty of booths (even an outdoor booth), but it wasn't crowded and a lot of people seemed to be there. I was also pleasantly surprised at how the restaurant was clean! It's a great way for an intimate birthday party, with enough seating and an enjoyable atmosphere. The only issue I had was that the food was kind of weird, I had a lot of chicken and beef and it tasted gross, but I felt guilty about eating it. I also noticed that the waitress was a little slow at getting my food and taking it to her table. The service was friendly, but I think they really need to find\n"

I've never had anything I had to say but the customer service was not good.  The service was terrible.  The service was a bit slow as it usually is.  I had to wait 20 minutes for everything because I was expecting to hear something and not be waiting a long time.  The menu is mostly just a collection of food for the little under 7$ I had for lunch.  I would not recommend this place.\n"

I had a few drinks and she did a great job cleaning up the dishes and bringing out the salad for us to enjoy.  Also, I had the gyoza and I think we both liked it.  The food was tasty.  The service was also great.  The patio and the patio chairs were really cool, and the wait staff was very friendly.  They even brought out our own drinks and snacks.  We also enjoyed the seafood entrees which were really good!  The decor was really cool, and the drinks and appetizers were really good!  The drinks were priced very well at reasonable prices.  I have found that the prices for most of my family's dinners (both casual and more traditional) are really close to the traditional fare, so that's not a surprise to me, but it\n"

I also find that they make a large cone which is what I like to order. Their ice cream is usually very good though. The staff is very friendly! It's a bit on the pricey side too, because they pay for ice cream on a regular basis. I highly recommend it to anyone!\n",

      "0:  OMG I absolutely loved these two guys who were the best of my class. The quality of their pedicures were also fantastic. I'd give them two stars (1.5 for a great pedicure and a 4) if only because it is located in a really nice neighborhood! If you have a budget, you could get a 2-star for the quality of the pedi but I feel like you get a better deal if you're the cost of the service. The overall quality of my pedi was great.The only thing I wish I had a bit more experience with are the prices. I had to wait 2 minutes to get my pedi done, then just go out in the middle of the day and pay $12 for 2 pedi that cost over $40.\n",

      "1:  OMG I absolutely loved this place! The food was amazing and the atmosphere was amazing. But I'd say the food was average at best. I ordered the \"Grit\" taco with avocado, chicken and lime juice which was pretty good. The price was cheap too, I got the \"Iced\" taco. The meat was delicious. I'd probably order more tacos, but they look like they would be good. I have a new house in the area that really knows their food.\n",

      "2:  OMG I absolutely loved the fact that this establishment is located in the parking lot of the Hilton Bayou, so you can take it all the way out to the casino just to get to the casino, and you'll know you're in Vegas!  You have to go there the night before for a reservation but its in the parking lot so its a great place to stay and enjoy the entertainment the night before so you don't feel like you're trapped in a weird, claustrophobic, and very claustrophobic hotel.  My only real complaint is the food is very underwhelming. The portions are HUGE so it's important to note this is by far my favorite place in Vegas.  We had the pork, chicken, ribs, mac and cheese sandwich for our table that was a size of the size of my boyfriend's hand and it was delicious!  The pork was so flavorful that it was almost like it had been put in a bowl for the first time for a week.  I can't seem to get the sauce I ordered anywhere else, but this place is one of the best places I've been to in the city, so I'll be trying something different every time. I did get a bottle of wine and a beer, it is definitely one I would order again, but this one is way too sweet for my taste and definitely not worth the effort!\n",
